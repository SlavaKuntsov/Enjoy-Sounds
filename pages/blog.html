				<div class="text">
					<p>In the world of music, vinyl records have long become not just a carrier of music, but also a real work of art. The modern design of record covers is not only a simple design element, but also an object of true admiration and love among collectors.</p>
					<p>Vinyl record covers can be a real work of art, not only because of the genius of the design, but also because they have become an integral part of the musical product. Many albums released on vinyl were decorated by famous artists. One of the most famous covers in the history of vinyl records is the album of The Beatles "Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", designed by artist Peter Blake.</p>

				<p>Led Zeppelin's album was first released at Atlantic Records and was recorded in just 36 hours. And although the musicians didn't have much money, they paid for its creation on their own. The album was successfully rolled out by the band on one of the tours. He is considered the forerunner of the heavy metal musical direction.</p>

			<div class="legend">
				<img src="/img/main/legend2.png" alt="">
				<p>The band's songs touch on social issues, and the compositions themselves are recorded in different styles: punk rock, soul, funk, jazz. The vinyl record cover imitates the cover of Elvis Presley's debut album. The photo is recognized as one of the most successful among the world's rock and roll pictures.</p>

			<div class="legend">
				<img src="/img/main/legend3.png" alt="">
				<p>This album includes all the variety of musical preferences of the band members: there is rock and roll, blues, country,folk. Critics called the album too motley, and the public did not accept it at all. The tenth release of "rolling stones" became one of the best not only for the band itself, but also in rock music in general.</p>

				<p>Miles and his sextet released an album based entirely on modality, as opposed to his early hardbop work. It wasn't the first time he worked in this style, but, apparently, it was to Kind of Blue that he so honed his technique and understanding, recipes for creating material and correct recording, that the album was eventually almost unanimously recognized as the best jazz record of all time.</p>

			<h2>Interesting Fact!</h2>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Songs that are located closer to the center of the vinyl record sound better than songs on the outer edges. Why is this happening?
					The rotation speed of the vinyl record is the same on the first track and on the last, but the track length on the first track is 2-3 times longer than on the last. This means that an equal length accommodates a greater amount of sound information in the form of protrusions and depressions, which in turn increases the number of possible noises and minor inaccuracies that would remain unnoticed at a shorter length (which happens closer to the center of the vinyl record, where the playing radius is smaller).</p>
